# multiSerial
(Another) multi-serial tool (SPI, I2C and UART) hardware adapter for the PC.

This tool is designed to provide 4 serial ports to the PC: 
* 2 asynchronous UARTs
* 1 SPI master
* 1 SPI slave 
* 1 I2C (internal or external powered)

## Hardware
The board will be connected to the PC using a single USB-C cable. To connect its interfaces to the circuit, you can use several "jumper cables" or a 20-pin ribbon cable.
This is a WIP. Stay tuned!
